# Autoclicker
### Motivation
Simple autoclicker with the ability to remap activation to any key

### How to install
Download latest release and unzip. The .exe file and .config file needs to be in the same directory, highly recommended to move the shortcut or create a new one.

### How to use
This application consists of 4 parts
* Delay
  The amount of milliseconds between each click (there is a delay minimum due to certain limitations)

* randomdelay
  Adds a random delay between 0 and specified random delay

* Toggle
  Gives you the choice of either having a toggleable activation or a button-down activation

* record
  click on the button to remap the activation key

To activate the autoclicker, simply press the hotkey given as the activation key. By pressing 'ctrl+shift+o', you will be able to kill the program in emergencies. 

### Limitations
* This program currently runs on one thread, which means u will often have to hold the toggle key and wait for the click cycle to finish.
* It is currently not possible to remap the activation key to any mouse buttons.
